# direct_edge_imu
This is the webpage of our latest work about fusion of direct edge alignment and inertial measurements. We have a paper, namely 'Direct Edge Alignment-Based Visual-Inertial Fusion for Tracking of Aggressive Motions', submitted to "Autonomous Robots".

We will release our source code if our journal paper is accepted. Our implementation is compatible with the standard driver of VI-Sensor and ROS version of indigo. OpenCV and Eigen are needed.

The high resolution video of our submitted paper is: http://1drv.ms/1QlCTbl

If you use our code, please cite our paper:
